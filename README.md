# oracle-jdbc-tester

[![Maven Build](https://github.com/aimtiaz11/oracle-jdbc-tester/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aimtiaz11/oracle-jdbc-tester/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

A simple command line application to test JDBC connection to Oracle Database.

## How to run

Clone this repository and then run below Maven command to build the executable JAR file.

```
mvn clean package
```

Alternatively, download the JAR file from [release](https://github.com/aimtiaz11/jdbc-tester/releases) page. 

Execute the JAR file with the following 3 parameters with schema name, password and JDBC connection string:

```sh
java -jar target/jdbc-tester-1.1.jar <schema_name> <schema_password> jdbc:oracle:thin:@//<host>:<port>/<SID>
```

## How to run docker-compose.yml  
Required installed docker and docker compose   
Clone this repository and then create .env file with DB credentials, host ip and port.  
For example see in .env_example  
After this run:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
  


### Secure your credentials

When running this tool ad-hoc, a good security practice would be read the DB username and password into a variable by using `read` command in Linux (or similar) and then execute the JAR file.

This prevents DB credentials being stored in `~/.bash_history`.


```sh
java -jar target/jdbc-tester-1.1.jar "$DB_USER" "$DB_PASS" jdbc:oracle:thin:@//<host>:<port>/<SID>
```

## How it works

The application connects to the Oracle database and executes a single SQL query: `select sysdate from dual` and prints the output. 

If it cannot connect for whatever reason, it will fail by logging an error message.

There is a hardcoded connection timeout set to 10 seconds.
